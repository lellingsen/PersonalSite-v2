    Welcome to my personal site, which is mainly used to house some of my
    writing. I've been in the software industry for a little over a decade,
    having spent around half that time as an engineer, and the other half as an
    engineering manager. Currently, I'm a Senior Software Engineer at <a
      href="https://lifeatdashlane.com/">Dashlane</a
    >. Most of my writing is about writing software, technology, management, or
    habits.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also use this as a sandbox for me to try out some technology that I
    wouldn't normally get to in my day job - like <a
      href="https://docs.astro.build/">Astro</a
    > and <a href="">Netlify</a>, which are the key building blocks of the
    current version. A previous iteration was using Gatsby v2 and Tailwind.

    pull request if you find a mistake!
