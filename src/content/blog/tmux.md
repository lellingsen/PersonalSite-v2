## Introduction

After [getting started in VIM](/blog/my-start-in-vim/), I knew that I wanted to
continue learning how to better leverage the terminal by spending time to learn
[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). "tmux" is short for "terminal
multiplexer," which means that you can host multiple terminal sessions inside of
a single one. If this is starting to sound like _Inception_, then you're on the
right track to understanding what's going on!

## Typical Use Cases

SSH

Many sessions

Contractors or personal projects

## How I use tmux

Project windows

Utility windows

Doing as much as I can in the terminal

## Next-level tmux

Plugins

Custom scripting
